## Reflection

#### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The code given was the GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.yp files. In the treasure map file, I was given the environment, experience for replay, the build of the model, and playing the game. The goal was to create code for the Q-Training Algorithm.
The code I created was the pseudocode to tell the "pirate" how to learn the environment and find the treasure the fastest way possible. The possibility of movement needed to be random and reset. The episodes needed to continue to flow to the next one if the system was unsucessful. These steps were all put in a loop to describe what happens when the system wins and loses.

#### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists create, develop, and analyze code for the given program. It matters because of what can and cannot be accomplished. This can be was is intended or what is not intended. Computer scientists can affect programs that may be used for every day life or in larger platforms, such as the government.

#### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, the key to approaching a problem should be to understand it and break it down into smaller sub-problems. Once we know what the problem is, a computer scientist can design an algorithm and implement it into the program. The most important part is to test the final output over and over to make sure that the results are stable. Each problem is going to be different so it is important to create sub-problems and find the root of the original problem. 

#### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
The ethical responsibilities is to create unbiased content. What ever is fed into an AI learning machine will be used for good and bad. Any type of input that could alter the results to something that is one-sided, should be carefully considered.
